        The origins of stained glass are not certain, but ancient Egyptians were probably the first people to discover glass as 
        the oldest examples of man-made glass are Egyptian colored glass beads from around 2700 BC. 
        Stained glass windows were first used by wealthy Romans in their homes in the first century AD.

        Stained Glass windows are commonly found in Churches and Cathedrals. 
        A trend which started in the early medieval period, which came to a decline
        at the end of the renaissance in Europe due to protestant views on art. 
        The stained glass we think of today originated in the 10th Century, 
        in tandem with gothic Cathedrals.

    <h3>How it was made</h3>
    <p>
        To make stained glass, potash and sand were mixed to 
        3000 degrees Fahrenheit and various metallic oxide powders were added to 
        create different colors.
        The glass was then flattened into sheets while it was still pliable. 
        The artists would have a blue print 
        of the design of the window on a large board-the sheets of glass would be 
        laid on top of the blue print and cut into the approximate sizes needed. 
        The pieces were finished by grozing. 
        Sometimes, details were painted onto the stained glass windows with a special paint
         made from ground glass and iron filings that were suspended in urine or wine;
          this mixture helped block light and define designs. 
          The finished pieces of glass were fitted into H-shaped strips of lead called cames.
           The cames were soldered together to create panels, which were then put into a 
           frame made of iron called an armature; at this point the window was complete and 
           ready to be put in the wall.
